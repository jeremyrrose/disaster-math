# Disaster Math

This package posits that a rift in spacetime has ruined arithmetic. `2 + 2` still equals `4`, but let's not even get in to anything more complicated than that.

The rules are stupid, so don't bother to understand them!

Use the functions exported from this package -- `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` -- to derive the "correct" answers in this ridiculous universe.

## Exports

The default export from the package is an object containing `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` keys with the corresponding function.

Each function is also individually exported.

## Usage

### `add`

Syntax: `add(n1, n2)`

Returns: The alternate-universe "sum" of `n1` and `n2`.

### `subtract`

Syntax: `subtract(n1, n2)`

Returns: The alternate-universe "difference" of `n1` and `n2`.

### `multiply`

Syntax: `multiply(n1, n2)`

Returns: The alternate-universe "product" of `n1` and `n2`.

### `divide`

Syntax: `divide(n1, n2)`

Returns: The alternate-universe "quotient" of `n1` and `n2`.

## I, for one, welcome the new nonsense math!
